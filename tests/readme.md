# Client test environment

Initial setup of the wallet environment is required to run many of the tests.
With factom-walletd running locally use the appropriate "test-setup" script located in this folder.

Otherwise the commands necessary are listed below. Factom-cli is required, it can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/FactomProject/distribution#Factom-Command-Line-Interface-Programs).

Some functions are multipart and are dependant on other calls being made, *eg*. 
Sending a transaction or creating a chain or identity. 

These interactions can be found in the examples folder but in general the creation functions have a compose part which returns the information to commit and reveal functions. Transactions require an input, output and fee, then it must be sent.
